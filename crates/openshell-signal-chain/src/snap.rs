//! Snap — hard-locked fact with confidence.
//!
//! A snap is a ground-truth anchor in the signal chain. Once locked, it
//! constrains all downstream inferences. Think of it as a measurement from
//! a calibrated instrument — it's as close to "true" as you get.
//!
//! # Confidence Levels
//!
//! - **1.0**: Absolute ground truth (mathematical proof, verified sensor reading)
//! - **0.8-0.99**: High confidence (replicated measurement, consensus)
//! - **0.5-0.79**: Moderate (single measurement, plausible claim)
//! - **< 0.5**: Low (unverified, speculative)
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use openshell_signal_chain::Snap;
//!
//! let snap = Snap::absolute(serde_json::json!({"depth": 87.2}), 0.0);
//! assert_eq!(snap.confidence, 1.0);
//! ```

/// A hard-locked fact in a room.
///
/// Snaps are the ground truth anchors in the signal chain. They always appear
/// in query results regardless of dial position (only inferences are filtered).
///
/// Use [`Snap::new`] for arbitrary confidence or [`Snap::absolute`] for
/// guaranteed facts (confidence = 1.0).
///
/// # Fields
///
/// - `fact`: Arbitrary JSON data representing the fact.
/// - `confidence`: How certain we are (0.0–1.0, clamped).
/// - `dial_position`: The dial position of the room when this snap was created.
/// - `timestamp`: When this snap was created (UTC).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use openshell_signal_chain::Snap;
///
/// let snap = Snap::new(
///     serde_json::json!({"sonar": "contact at 200m"}),
///     0.95,
///     0.1,
/// );
/// assert_eq!(snap.confidence, 0.95);
