//! Constraint Spline — the fare curvatures of truth, bounds that bend.
//!
//! The core insight: constraint bounds are not binary. They have curvature.
//! A value at the edge of a hard constraint (lo=0, hi=127, value=126) carries
//! different information than the same value at the center (value=63). The
//! curvature encodes how close you are to the boundary and what the cost of
//! crossing it is.
//!
//! The signal chain's dial (0.0 hard → 1.0 soft) controls how those curvatures
//! are interpreted:
//! - **0.0 (hard):** curvature is existential — crossing the boundary is failure
//! - **0.5 (balanced):** curvature is informational — crossing the boundary is cost
//! - **1.0 (soft):** curvature is optional — crossing the boundary is guidance
//!
//! This module provides the bridge between FLUX constraint engines and the
//! signal chain's dial-controlled reasoning.
