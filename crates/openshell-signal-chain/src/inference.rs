//! Inference — soft extrapolation with confidence.
//!
//! An inference is a hypothesis that may or may not be true. Unlike snaps,
//! inferences are filtered by the dial threshold during queries — at low dial
//! positions only high-confidence inferences appear, while at high positions
//! everything passes.
//!
//! # Confidence Levels
//!
//! - **0.8+**: Likely — multiple supporting signals, high prior probability
//! - **0.4-0.8**: Speculative — plausible but unverified
//! - **< 0.4**: Wild guess — included only at near-1.0 dial positions
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use openshell_signal_chain::Inference;
//!
//! let inf = Inference::likely(serde_json::json!({"anomaly": true}), 0.3);
//! assert!(inf.confidence >= 0.8);
//! ```

/// A soft extrapolation/hypothesis in a room.
///
/// Inferences are predictions, hypotheses, or suggestions. They can be
/// elevated to snaps when verified. During queries, inferences are filtered
/// by the dial threshold — only those with `confidence >= threshold` pass.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// - `hypothesis`: Arbitrary JSON data representing the hypothesis.
/// - `confidence`: How likely the hypothesis is correct (0.0–1.0, clamped).
/// - `dial_position`: The dial position of the room when this was created.
/// - `timestamp`: When this inference was created (UTC).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use openshell_signal_chain::Inference;
///
/// let inf = Inference::new(
///     serde_json::json!({"target": "vessel", "probability": 0.7}),
///     0.7,
///     0.5,
/// );
/// assert_eq!(inf.confidence, 0.7);
